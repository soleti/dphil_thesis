This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge, the content of this thesis is my own work. This thesis has not been submitted for any degree or other purposes.
I certify that the intellectual content of this thesis is the product of my own work and that all the assistance received in preparing this thesis and sources have been acknowledged. Results and figures from published works by others have been clearly attributed.

Chapters \ref{ch:1-intro} and \ref{ch:2-neutrinophysics} contain a theoretical introduction to the state of the art in the field. Chapter \ref{ch:3-anomalies} shows the previous results on the same topic and the motivations of the study presented here. Chapter \ref{ch:4-microboone} gives a brief overview of the MicroBooNE detector, whose data was used to produce the results of this thesis. 
Chapter \ref{sec:eventreco} describes the reconstruction techniques used to allow a high-level analysis of the data. The analysis is thoroughly described in Chapters \ref{ch:6-analysis}, \ref{sec:systematics}, \ref{sec:sensitivity}, and, where not specified otherwise, is entirely my own work.

I am the corresponding author of the paper in Appendix \ref{sec:mucs} and I produced all the results and plots shown there.
