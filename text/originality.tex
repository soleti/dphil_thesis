Chapters 1 and 2 contains a theoretical introduction to the state of the art in the field. Chapter 3 shows the previous results on the same topic and the motivations of the study presented here. Chapter 4 gives a brief overview of the MicroBooNE detector, whose data was used to produce the results of this thesis. 
Chapter 5 describes the reconstruction techniques used to allow a high-level analysis of the data. The analysis is thoroughly described in Chapter 6, which, where not specified otherwise, is entirely my own work.
