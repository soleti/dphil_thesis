In this section we will describe the process that transforms the raw digitised waveforms collected by the DAQ into high-level objects that can be used for physics analysis. 

\section{Noise removal and signal deconvolution}
The ASIC chips placed in the liquid argon produce an inherent irreducible noise, caused by thermal fluctuations and charge trapping and de-trapping in the input transistor \cite{Acciarri:2017sde}. 

However, MicroBooNE is also affected by excess noise beyond the expected inherent one.
