\section{Validation}
\subsection{Electromagnetic shower energy loss}
A way to verify if we are effectively selecting electron neutrinos is to study the distribution of the electromagnetic showers energy loss per length $dE/dx$. If the data events contain a well-reconstructed electron in the final state, the $dE/dx$ distribution will be peaked around 2~MeV/cm.
Figure \ref{fig:dedx_after} shows the $dE/dx$ distributions for data and Monte Carlo after the application of the rectangular cuts (left) and after the application of the BDTs cuts (right). As expected, the peak is in both cases around 2~MeV/cm, meaning that the $dE/dx$ of the reconstructed showers in data are compatible with electrons in the final state.

\subsection{Side-bands checks}
In this section we will study the agreement between data and Monte Carlo for selected samples orthogonal to our $\nu_{e}$ CC0$\pi$-Np signal. In order to validate our analysis, some of the background cuts described in Section \ref{sec:bkg} are inverted or removed in order to enhance different background components.
\subsubsection{Photon-enhanced selection}
It is possible to enhance the neutral-current component (defined as \emph{beam intrinsic NC} in our analysis) by (1) inverting the cut on the shower $dE/dx$, , and (2) removing the cut on the shower distance (see Figures \ref{fig:dedx_norm}, \ref{fig:showerd_norm}). The $dE/dx$ of the most energetic shower must be within 3.2~MeV/cm and 5~MeV/cm to select electromagnetic cascades that were initiated by a photon. It also ensures that this photon-enhanced sample is orthogonal to the $\nu_{e}$ CC0$\pi$-Np selected sample. The cut on the shower distance is removed to include events where the photon conversion is far from the neutrino interaction vertex.
Thus, our final sample will mainly contain NC events, with some contamination of $\nu_{\mu}$ CC$\pi^{0}$ events where the muon track was tagged as a proton-like track.

Figure \ref{fig:photon} shows the comparison between data and Monte Carlo for the reconstructed energy spectrum $E_{deposited}$ of the photon-enhanced event spectrum. 
%The reconstructed energy $E_{corr}$ here corresponds to the sum of the reconstructed energies of the shower-like objects and the reconstructed energies of the track-like objects $E_{corr} = E_{corr}^{p}+E_{corr}^{e}$.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CC \texorpdfstring{$\nu_{\mu}$}{numu}-enhanced reverse cuts}
It is possible to enhance the presence of the CC $\nu_{\mu}$ background (defined as \emph{beam intrinsic $\nu_{\mu}$} in our analysis) by (1) removing the cut on the total number of hits in the collection plane, (2) removing the cut on the fraction of shower hits, (3) requiring a minimum track length, (4) requiring at least a track with $40 < \chi_p^{2} < 220$ (muon-like track), and (5) requiring that the event is selected by the external $\nu_{\mu}$ CC-inclusive analysis \cite{ubxsec} (see Figures \ref{fig:proton_norm}, \ref{fig:length_norm}). Also in this case the CC $\nu_{\mu}$-enhanced sample will be orthogonal to the $\nu_{e}$ CC0$\pi$-Np selected sample.
A CC $\nu_{\mu}$ event has, by definition, a muon in the final state: as such, requiring a track length larger than 20~cm and changing the cut on the proton $\chi^2_p$ score decreases our muon-rejection power. The goal of the external analysis is to select CC $\nu_{\mu}$ events, so instead of vetoing those events as described in Section \ref{sec:numu}, we invert this requirement by allowing only these events.

Figure \ref{fig:numu_inverted} shows the agreement between data and Monte Carlo for the reconstructed energy spectrum of the CC $\nu_{\mu}$-enhanced event spectrum.

% \subsection{Future Validation Studies}

% \subsubsection{Cosmic-ray studies}
% In order to validate the cosmic-ray components of our selected events it is possible to compare simulated events with a CORSIKA cosmic ray producing a flash in the optical system during the beam-gate window and the data off-beam sample. 
% In this way we will be able to check if the distributions of the variables we use (e.g. shower energy, shower $dE/dx$) show a good agreement between the simulation and a well-understood set of data events. 
% It will help to validate the cosmic background components and also the energy and $dE/dx$ reconstruction procedures.

\subsection{NuMI beam event studies}
It is possible to run this analysis on the complementary NuMI dataset, acquired with the NuMI beam trigger. The NuMI beam is created from 120 GeV protons hitting a carbon target, while the BNB is created from 8 GeV protons on a beryllium target. The NuMI beam has also a higher intrinsic $\nu_{e}$ component than the BNB (5\% vs. 0.5\%). Figure \ref{fig:numibeam} shows a comparison of the NuMI and BNB beam fluxes for the MicroBooNE detector. Even though it is off-axis, MicroBooNE still receives $\sim2500$ $\nu_{e}$ interactions per year. 

As such, a study of the events selected in the NuMI dataset is of fundamental importance to validate the $\nu_{e}$ CC0$\pi$-Np selection algorithm, since it provides a completely independent set of electron neutrinos with different energy and angular distributions.
